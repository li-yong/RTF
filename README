This Test framework wrote in Ruby, RTF means 'Ruby Test Framework', also I like it as 'Ryan Test Framework'.


 Features:
 . Intelligent Data Driven:
   setup parms Pa Pb in CSV file, then give validValue for Pa and Pb separately in their row,
   then the framework will generate combination of Pa&Pb then feed to commands.
   
 . LogLevel ()
   Controll log in color and different loglevel.
   
 . TestSuites (TestSets)
   are physically a Folder in Filesystem.
 
 . _global.conf
   the configuation in global namespace, any testcase can access variable in side without any preparation.
   
 . Testcase
   in CSV format: "Object", "Action", "Data"
   means "Do 'Action' with 'Data' against 'Object'"
   
   example1: "ANIP", "ssh", "rcfstest null srv=SNIP"
   equal "ssh 1.1.1.1  'rcfTest null svr=10.10.10.10'"
   
   example2: 
   Action,Object,Data,assert,ddcsvfile
   lcmd,#{LOCALHOST},date,cmdExitCode=0
       lcmd: local command
	   cmdExitCode=0 : check cmd exexuted normally.
   rsh_dd,#{LOCALHOST},echo cs=#{CVSDD_par1} bs=#{CVSDD_par2} ds=#{CVSDD_par3},!has(ERROR),/root/TE/test/ts_rcfs/conf/datapool/tc01_null.csv
       rshdd: rsh with data driven. 
	   /root/.*csv: the data pool used by cmd.
   
   
 . TurnOn Pcap
   when run IO against storage, turn the Package Capture on,
   
 . Capture Stdout, RegEx get expected value then save to _global.conf
 
 . TestSuite, TestCase list
   testSuite, testCase are stored in filesystem directory structure,
   the list switch scan the dir then list testSuite, testCase available.
